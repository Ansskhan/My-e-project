              <h3>The Big Bang Theory – How It All Began</h3>
              <p>Imagine rewinding time back to the very beginning—before stars, planets, or even space itself existed.
                The Big Bang Theory is the leading explanation of how our universe started. About 13.8 billion years
                ago,
                everything we see today was squeezed into a tiny, unimaginably dense and hot point, called a
                singularity.
                Then, in an instant, it expanded—not like an explosion, but more like a balloon inflating.</p>

            <h3>What is big bang theory?</h3>
            <p>The Big Bang Theory explains the origin of the universe. Around 13.8 billion years ago, the universe
              began
              as a tiny, dense, and hot point, then rapidly expanded. This expansion continues today, shaping galaxies,
              stars, and planets. Scientists support this theory with evidence like cosmic microwave background
              radiation
              and the expanding universe. The Big Bang marks the beginning of time, space, and everything we knowLorem

          <h4>According to Quran</h4>
          <p>chapter 21, verse 30 of the Quran states that:</p>
          <p>"Do not those who disbelieve see that the heavens and the earth were a closed-up mass, then We opened them
            out? And We made every living thing from water. Will they not then believe?"</p>
          <p>This part aligns with modern cosmology, particularly the Big Bang Theory, which suggests that the universe
            was initially a singular, dense entity before expanding. The idea that the heavens (space) and the earth
            were once together and then separated resembles the concept of cosmic expansion</p>
          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h5>Scientifically:</h5>
            </li>
            The Big Bang Theory is the most widely accepted explanation for the origin of the universe. It states
            that the universe began around 13.8 billion years ago from an extremely hot, dense point and has been
            expanding ever since. Evidence such as cosmic microwave background radiation, redshift of galaxies, and
            abundance of light elements support this theory. However, while the Big Bang explains the origin and
            expansion of the universe, it does not address what existed before it or what caused it—questions that
            remain open for scientific exploration.

            <li>
              <h5>In Quran Perspective:</h5>
            </li>
            The Qur'an (21:30) states that the heavens and the earth were once a "closed-up mass" before being "opened
            out," a description that aligns with the Big Bang concept. The Quran does not provide a scientific formula
            but offers a broader insight into creation, emphasizing that the universe was brought into existence by
            divine will. Additionally, the Quran repeatedly encourages reflection on the cosmos, nature, and life,
            showing that science and faith are not necessarily in conflict but can complement each other.
