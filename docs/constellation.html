                        <h3>Constellations – The Starry Patterns in the Sky</h3>
                        <p>Have you ever looked up at the night sky and noticed how some stars seem to form shapes or
                            patterns? These patterns are called constellations. They have been important to people for
                            thousands of years, helping with navigation, storytelling, and even farming. Every culture
                            has its own way of seeing these star groups, making the night sky full of history and
                            wonder.</p>

                    <h3>What Are Constellations?</h3>
                    <p>A constellation is a group of stars that appear to form a shape when viewed from Earth. These
                        stars are not actually close to each other, but from our point of view, they create patterns.
                        Some look like animals, people, or objects. Astronomers have officially named 88 constellations
                        that cover the entire sky.</p>
                    <h3>Why Are Constellations Important?</h3>
                    <p>Before maps and compasses, people used the stars to travel and keep track of seasons. Farmers
                        knew when to plant and harvest by watching how constellations moved. Even today, constellations
                        help astronomers map the sky and locate different stars and planets.

                    <h3>According to the Quran</h3>
                    <p>The Quran also speaks about the stars and their purpose in the universe. In Surah Al-Furqan
                        (25:61), it states:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <p>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Statement:</h4>"Blessed is He who has placed in the sky great stars and placed
                                therein a [burning] lamp and luminous moon."
                            </li>
                            This verse highlights the divine order and beauty of celestial objects, including stars that
                            form constellations. The Quran often mentions the stars as signs of guidance, both
                            physically and spiritually. In Surah An-Nahl (16:16), it says:
                        </p>
                        <li style="list-style-type: none;">"And landmarks, and by the stars they are guided."
                        </li>
                        <p>The Quran encourages reflection on the universe, aligning with the study of constellations
                            and the wonders of space.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Can You See Constellations From Anywhere?
                    </h3>
                    <p>Yes, but it depends on where you live and the time of year. Some constellations are only visible
                        in certain seasons. If you are in the Northern Hemisphere, you will see constellations like
                        Orion and Ursa Major, while in the Southern Hemisphere, you can spot constellations like the
                        Southern Cross.</p>
                    <h3>Conclusion
                    </h3>
                    <p>Constellations are like nature’s artwork, connecting us to history, science, and culture. Whether
                        you love space or just enjoy stargazing, these star patterns make the universe feel a little
                        closer to home. So, next time you look up at the night sky, try finding a constellation and
                        imagine the stories behind it!
