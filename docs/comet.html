                            <h3>Comets – The Wandering Stars of Our Solar System</h3>
                            <p>Comets have amazed people for a long time. These bright, mysterious streaks in the
                                night
                                sky
                                are often called “cosmic snowballs.” They’re some of the oldest objects in our solar
                                system
                                and can tell us a lot about how it all began. Unlike planets, comets have long,
                                stretched-out orbits, taking hundreds or even thousands of years to go around the
                                Sun.

                        <h3>What are comets and how they formed?</h3>
                        <p>Comets are small space objects made of ice, rock, and dust. They mostly come from two
                            places:
                            the
                            Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud, which are way out in the solar system. When a comet gets
                            close
                            to the Sun, the heat makes its icy core turn into gas, creating a glowing cloud called a
                            coma.
                            This gas and dust get pushed away by the Sun’s energy, forming a long, beautiful tail
                            that
                            we
                            can see from Earth.</p>

                        <h4>Parts of a Comet</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <p class="fs-5">A comet has three main parts:</p>
                            <li>
                                <h5>Nucleus:</h5> The solid, frozen center made of ice, rock, and some organic
                                stuff.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h5>Coma:</h5> The cloud of gas and dust that forms around the nucleus when it warms
                                up.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h5>Tail:</h5> The glowing streak of dust and gas that always points away from the
                                Sun
                                because of solar energy.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>According to Quran</h4>
                        <p>The Quran mentions celestial phenomena that some interpret as references to comets and
                            meteors.
                            For instance, it describes meteors as missiles used by angels against jinns, and there
                            are
                            verses that suggest the presence of ice in the heavens, which some link to comets. These
                            interpretations highlight the Quran's connection to cosmic events.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <h5>Verses:</h5>
                                <p><b>Surah Al-Mulk (67:5):</b> "And We have certainly beautified the nearest heaven
                                    with stars and have made [from] them what is thrown at the devils and have
                                    prepared
                                    for them the punishment of the Blaze."</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Famous Coments</h4>
                        <p>Many comets have made a big impact on human history. One of the most famous is Halley’s
                            Comet,
                            which shows up about every 76 years and has been seen since ancient times. Another
                            well-known
                            comet is Hale-Bopp, which lit up the sky in 1997 and amazed people everywhere. More
                            recently,
                            Comet NEOWISE was a stunning sight in 2020, visible to anyone who looked up.</p>
